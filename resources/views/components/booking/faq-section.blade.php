                    Come with a brief description of your project goals, target audience, and any specific features
                    you have in mind. If you have reference websites or designs, that's helpful too. Don't worry if
                    you're not fully prepared—we'll guide you through the discovery process.

                    Yes, absolutely! All consultation calls are 100% free with no obligations. We believe in
                    providing value upfront and building relationships based on trust. You'll receive honest advice
                    and recommendations whether or not you decide to work with us.

                    Of course! Life happens. You can reschedule or cancel your appointment through the confirmation
                    email you'll receive. We just ask for at least 24 hours notice so we can offer that time slot to
                    someone else.

                    If you're just starting and exploring options, choose the Discovery Call. For projects with
                    defined technical requirements, opt for Technical Consultation. If you're ready to move forward
                    and need detailed planning, book a Project Discussion. Not sure? Start with Discovery—we can
                    always schedule additional sessions.
