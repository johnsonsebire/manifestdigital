# Staff Project Management System - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Staff Project Management System provides a comprehensive interface for administrators and staff to manage client projects from initiation to completion. This includes project CRUD operations, team management, progress tracking, and activity monitoring.

## Architecture

### Routes
All staff project routes are prefixed with `/admin` and require admin access permissions:

```
GET    /admin/projects                          → admin.projects.index
POST   /admin/projects                          → admin.projects.store
GET    /admin/projects/create                   → admin.projects.create
GET    /admin/projects/{project}                → admin.projects.show
PATCH  /admin/projects/{project}                → admin.projects.update
DELETE /admin/projects/{project}                → admin.projects.destroy
GET    /admin/projects/{project}/edit           → admin.projects.edit
POST   /admin/projects/{project}/team           → admin.projects.team.add
DELETE /admin/projects/{project}/team/{member}  → admin.projects.team.remove
PATCH  /admin/projects/{project}/progress       → admin.projects.progress.update
```

**Protection**: All routes require `auth`, `verified`, and `can:access-admin-panel` middleware.

### Controller

#### `App\Http\Controllers\Admin\ProjectController`
Full-featured project management controller with comprehensive CRUD and team management.

**Methods:**

##### 1. `index(Request $request)`
Lists all projects with advanced filtering capabilities.

**Features:**
- Search by project title or order number
- Filter by status (pending, active, on_hold, completed, cancelled)
- Filter by assigned team member
- Date range filtering (start_date, end_date)
- Paginated results (15 per page)
- Statistics dashboard (total, active, pending, on_hold, completed counts)

**Query Optimization:**
- Eager loads: `order.customer`
- Returns: `$projects`, `$stats`, `$teamMembers`

##### 2. `create()`
Displays form to create a new project from an existing order.

**Features:**
- Lists orders without existing projects
- Excludes cancelled orders
- Displays order details (number, customer, items, total)

##### 3. `store(Request $request)`
Creates a new project and logs the creation activity.

**Validation:**
- `order_id` - required, must exist, must not have existing project
- `title` - required, max 255 characters
- `description` - optional text
- `start_date` - optional date
- `end_date` - optional date, must be after start_date
- `budget` - optional numeric, minimum 0
- `status` - required (pending, active, on_hold, completed, cancelled)

**Actions:**
- Creates project record
- Logs creation activity
- Redirects to project show page

##### 4. `show(Project $project)`
Displays comprehensive project details with all relationships.

**Eager Loading:**
- `order.customer`, `order.items.service`
- `tasks` (with assignedTo user)
- `milestones`
- `team.user`
- `files`
- `messages.user`
- `activities.user`

**Additional Data:**
- Available staff (not yet on team)

##### 5. `edit(Project $project)`
Displays project edit form.

**Loads:**
- Project with `order.customer` relationship

##### 6. `update(Request $request, Project $project)`
Updates project details and logs status changes.

**Validation:**
- `title` - required, max 255
- `description` - optional
- `start_date` - optional date
- `end_date` - optional date, after start_date
- `budget` - optional numeric, min 0
- `status` - required enum
- `completion_percentage` - optional, 0-100

**Logic:**
- Tracks status changes
- Logs status updates to activity log
- Records who made the change

##### 7. `destroy(Project $project)`
Deletes a project (with safety checks).

**Safety:**
- Cannot delete active projects
- Must change status first
- Soft deletes (if configured)

##### 8. `addTeamMember(Request $request, Project $project)`
Adds a staff member to the project team.

**Validation:**
- `user_id` - required, must exist
- `role` - required (manager, developer, designer, tester)

**Logic:**
- Checks for duplicate team members
- Creates team member record
- Logs addition to activity

##### 9. `removeTeamMember(Project $project, $teamMemberId)`
Removes a team member from the project.

**Logic:**
- Finds team member
- Logs removal
- Deletes team member record

##### 10. `updateProgress(Request $request, Project $project)`
Updates project completion percentage.

**Validation:**
- `completion_percentage` - required, 0-100

**Logic:**
- Updates completion percentage
- Auto-completes project if 100%
- Logs progress change

```

## Security & Authorization

### Route Protection
All admin project routes use middleware stack:
```php
['web', 'auth', 'verified', 'can:access-admin-panel']
```

### Controller-Level Security
- All methods check for admin access via gate
- Team member operations verify staff user existence
- Delete operations check project status
- Activity logging tracks all changes with user IDs

### View-Level Security
- Team dropdown only shows staff users (Admin, Staff roles)
- Delete button hidden for active projects
- Edit actions require admin permissions
- All forms use CSRF protection

## Data Flow

### Project Creation Flow
1. Staff clicks "New Project" button
2. System loads orders without existing projects
3. Staff selects order and fills project details
4. `ProjectController@store` validates and creates project
5. Activity log entry created
6. Redirect to project show page with success message

### Project Update Flow
1. Staff clicks "Edit" on project
2. System loads project with current values
3. Staff modifies fields
4. `ProjectController@update` validates changes
5. Status changes logged to activity
6. Project updated in database
7. Redirect to project show page

### Team Management Flow
1. Staff clicks "Add" on team members card
2. Form appears with available staff
3. Staff selects user and role
4. `ProjectController@addTeamMember` validates
5. Team member created
6. Activity logged
7. Page refreshes with new team member

### Progress Update Flow
1. Staff enters percentage in quick update form
2. `ProjectController@updateProgress` validates (0-100)
3. Completion percentage updated
4. If 100%, auto-complete project
5. Activity logged
6. Page refreshes with new progress

## Status Management

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Update progress regularly (weekly minimum)
   - Be honest about completion percentage
   - Use milestones to track major achievements
   - Keep customers informed of progress

4. **Status Management**
   - Update status promptly when circumstances change
   - Use "On Hold" for temporary pauses
   - Complete projects when all deliverables done
   - Document reasons for cancellations

### For Administrators

1. **Project Oversight**
   - Review active projects regularly
   - Monitor progress vs. deadlines
   - Identify at-risk projects early
   - Reallocate resources as needed

2. **Team Management**
   - Balance team workloads
   - Ensure appropriate skill matches

- Index frequently queried columns (status, created_at)
- Cache statistics dashboard data

### Recommended Indexes
```sql
-- projects table
INDEX idx_projects_status (status)
INDEX idx_projects_dates (start_date, end_date)
INDEX idx_projects_completion (completion_percentage)

-- project_team table
INDEX idx_team_user (user_id)
INDEX idx_team_project (project_id)

-- project_activities table
INDEX idx_activities_project (project_id)
INDEX idx_activities_user (user_id)
INDEX idx_activities_created (created_at)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Cannot create project - "Order already has a project"
**Solution:** Check if project was already created. Navigate to admin/projects and search for the order number.

**Issue:** Cannot delete project - "Cannot delete active projects"
**Solution:** Change project status to "Completed" or "Cancelled" first, then delete.

**Issue:** Team member not in dropdown
**Solution:** Verify user has Admin or Staff role. Check user is not already on the team.

**Issue:** Progress update not working
**Solution:** Ensure percentage is between 0-100. Check for JavaScript errors in console.

**Issue:** Activities not showing
**Solution:** Verify activity logging is enabled. Check database for activity records.
